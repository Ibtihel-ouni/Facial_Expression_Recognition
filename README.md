# Facial_Expression_Recognition 

We used  Convolutional neural networks (CNN) for facial expression recognition . The goal is to classify each facial image into one of the seven facial emotion categories considered  .

## **The Dataset  :**
We trained and tested our models on the dataset from the Kaggle [Facial Expression Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/rules), which comprises 48-by-48-pixel grayscale images of human faces,each labeled with one of 7 emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral .


we are going to :

1.  Develop a facial expression recognition model in Keras .
2.  Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) .

3.  Deploy the trained model to a web interface with Flask .
4.  Apply the model to real-time video streams and image data .

## **Test :** 
`python model.py`
